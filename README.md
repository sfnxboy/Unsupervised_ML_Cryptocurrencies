# Unsupervised Machine Learning: Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
Unlike supervised machine learning, we use unsupervised machine learning when there is no known output. Instead, unsupervised machine learning is used to find patterns, or groups, in date. For instance, a bank could use customer segmentation to offer credit cards according to demographics. They could group prospective card holders by age, geography, or gender. Perhaps they target generations, like millenials and baby boomers, or use income level or marital status. Its important to note that unsupervised machine learning uses input data only. In this project we will process data for an unsupervised model, group data using clustering and the K-means algorithm, and lastly make the models more efficient using principle component analysis.

In this project we will take a look at the world of cryptocurrency. The popularity of bitcoin has caused a price jump in the currency, which has rendered it out of reach for many new investors. Luckily for them, there are many other cryptocurrencies available at more affordable prices. In this project we will run unsupervised machine learning algorithms into trends related to these cryptocurrencies to determine whether or not it may be worth it to make a worthwhile investment in these currencies.

## Notes

### What is Unsupervised Machine Learning

In [supervised learning](https://github.com/sfnxboy/Supervised_ML_Credit_Risk), first a model is initiated, or a template for the algorithm is created. Then it will analyze the data and attempt to learn patterns, which is also called fitting and training. After the data has been fit and trained, it will then make predictions. In unsupervised machine learning (UML), there are no paired inputs and outcomes and the model uses the whole dataset as input. UML is used in one of the following two ways:  
- Transform the data to create an intuitive representation for analysis or to use in a nother machine learning module
- Cluster or determine patterns in a grouping of data, rather than to predict a classification

There are generally two types of unsupervised learning, transformations and clustering algorithms. We use **transformations** when we need to take raw data and make it easier to understand. Transformations also can help prepare data so that it can be used for other machine learning algorithms. Transformations can reduce the dimensional representation, which simply means we'll be decreasing the number of features used for the model or analysis. After doing so, the data can either be processed for use in other algorithms or narrowed down so it can be viewed in 2D. We use **clustering algorithms** to group similar objects into clusters. For example, if a cable service wants to group those with similar viewing habits, we would use a clustering algorithm.

There are **challenges** that arise when working with unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Firstly, since there is no specified outcome, there is not analytical way to know if the result is correct. When working with supervised machine learning algorithms we could simply calculate the accuracy and precision of a model, that isn't possible with UML. This leads to issues when decising whether the model has provided any helpful information we can use. The only way to determine what an unsupervised algorithm did with the data is to go through it manually or create visualizations. Since there will be a manual aspect, unsupervised learning is great for when you want to explore the data. Sometimes you'll use the information provided to you by the unsupervised algorithm to transition to a more targeted, supervised model.

### Preprocessing Data

As with supervised learning, data should be preprocessed into a correct format with only numerical values, null value determination, and so forth. The only difference is unsupervised learning doesn't have a target variableâ€”it only has input features that will be used to find patterns in the data. It's important to carefully select features that could help to find those patterns or create groups.

- **Data Selection:** Consider what data is available, what data is missing, and what data can be removed. Data selection entails making good choices about which data will be used.
- **Data Processing:** Data processing involves organizing the data by formatting, cleaning, and sampling it. For instance, say the date column in your dataset has dates in two different formates, we would convert all dates to the same format. 
- **Data Transformation:** Data transformation entails transforming datasets into a simpler format for storage and future use, such as a CSV, spreadsheet, or database file.
